## Notes

* I initially setup a multi-module project, to keep the frontend and backend separate. But this proved a hassle trying
  to start/stop the backend process from the frontend automatically. For simplicity's sake, I set it up as a single
  project and a single Spring Boot application. This way the embedded Tomcat instance will serve both sides.

* In true BDD/TDD fashion, I have selected to not use any JS framework, to deliver the simplest implementation that
  respects the present specifications. So straight
  JavaScript was used.
